# dwarf-cpp23
## A simulation based game about a dwarven brewery written in C++23.
### The goal of the project is to provide a demo of a custom game engine using SDL2 and modular C++23 that showcases a dynamic fake-3D tile system, simulation based character development, and a custom path finding algorhythm.
## Todo:
- [x] Get rid of the nested loops (put the whole tile system in a single vector)
- [x] Add dynamic shading
- [ ] Fix selection logic to only apply to visible tiles
- [x] Add animated dwarf
- [ ] Add layer awareness to dwarf (fall until ground is found)
- [ ] Add point and click movement to dwarf
- [ ] Add tile awareness to dwarf (go around inactive tiles)
- [ ] Add interlayer travel capabilities (ladder building task?)
- [ ] Add digging task
- [ ] Add underground visibility system (manual)
- [ ] Add camera motion
- [ ] Add "follow dwarf" feature to camera
- [ ] Add underground visibility system (automatic)
- [ ] Add more tasks (resource gathering, building)
- [ ] Add some dwarf personality traits
- [ ] Add UI
- [ ] Add first dialog window (being recognised by another dwarf clan for example?)
- [ ] Add trading feature
- [ ] Add dwarf needs (sleeping, eating, drinking, recreation, socialisation, etc...)
- [ ] Add hostile mechanics (orcs attack, elf steal recipes, flood, ...)
- [ ] Add proceduraly generated environmental elements
- [ ] Add goal (some achievement based final reward then sandbox?)
